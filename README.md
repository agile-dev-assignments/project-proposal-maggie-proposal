# Project Proposal
### Project title

Travel Wise

### What and why?

Travel Wise would help individuals and groups make travel plans based on budget, trip purpose, and interests. There are a lot of moving parts to keep track of when making travel plans. Travel Wise would provide the user with travel suggestions and an easy to follow checklist to (1) make planning and decision making easier and (2) ensure no important planning issues fall through the cracks. This would be useful for people who travel for work or for people planning group vacations for family or friends. This could potentially be useful for people planning larger events like destination weddings as well.

### For whom?

This software would be meant for anyone who needs help planning travel (individual or group). This could be targeted toward businesses who require their employees to travel, families planning vacations, people planning large destination events, school clubs planning trips with multiple members, etc.

### How?

The user would create a profile. They would be able to add friends through their username. 

I’m envisioning a dashboard where users could view their current and past trips as well as create new trips. Once a new trip is created, the user would be able to add friends to the trip. There would be levels of membership for the trip including owner (the user who creates the trip), admin (the users who have authority to make changes to the trip), and attendees (who can view the plans). 

The trip page would consist of a checklist of to-do items such as ‘book flights,’ ‘book accommodation,’ and ‘plan activities.’  Each item could have a status of ‘not started,’ ‘in progress,’ or ‘done.’ During the in progress phase, the admin could request relevant information from attendees in order to book flights and accomodations. Admins could also make polls and give attendees options on where to stay, where to eat, or what activities to do.

For each to-do item, the app would offer suggestions to the user. For example, if the user is planning a budget vacation, the app might recommend cheap flights to somewhere warm. If the user is planning a work trip, the app might recommend hotels for business travellers. 

Once the to-do items are checked off, the app would create an exportable itinerary complete with flight info, scheduled activities, and pricing info.

### Scope

I am honestly unsure of how long it would take to make an algorithm that could recommend flights and accommodations based on user preferences. I think this would be the most challenging part of this project because it would require some sort of integration between the app and other websites like Kayak, Expedia, or Airbnb. The rest of the project (creating the interface and ability to make accounts) seems like it would be relatively easy to complete. I think this project would be doable for a group of 4-6 to complete in one semester and would not be too easy.
